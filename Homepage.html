            <h2>About the Underwater Ecosystem</h2>
            <p>
            Planet Earth is mostly made up of water, both fresh and salt water. The latter covers more than 70% of the Earthâ€™s surface, representing 90% of the habitable space. This environment is home to a great diversity of marine animals, which inhabit all types of ecosystems, from coastal to oceanic.
            The underwater ecosystem is a dynamic and vital part of Earth's biosphere, supporting life and providing essential services such as oxygen production, carbon sequestration, and food resources for human populations. Preserving and understanding marine ecosystems is crucial for the health of our planet and future generations.

            <h2>Marine Species</h2>
            <h4>Blue Whale (Balaenoptera Musculus)</h4>
            <p>
                The blue whale is the largest animal on Earth, reaching lengths of up to 100 feet. Blue whales are not only remarkable for their size but also for their ecological importance as apex predators in marine ecosystems. They play a crucial role in the balance of ocean food webs and are a symbol of conservation efforts to protect Earth's marine biodiversity. They are found in oceans worldwide and primarily feed on krill by filter-feeding through baleen plates.

            <h2>Marine Habitats</h2>
            <h4>Coral Reefs</h4>
            <p>
                These are underwater structures formed by colonies of tiny coral polyps. Coral reefs are found in tropical and subtropical waters and are known for their high biodiversity, providing habitat for numerous fish, invertebrates, and other marine organisms.
